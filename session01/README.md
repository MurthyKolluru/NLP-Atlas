# NLP-Atlas: Session 01

This repository contains code, notebooks, and resources for **Session 01** of the NLP-Atlas project.  
Files and folders are numbered in the order they appeared in class.

## Embeddings & Models

1. **001** – Term Document Embedding (Python file)  
2. **002** – Singular Value Decomposition Embedding (Python files)  
3. **003** – Word2Vec (Notebook)  
4. **004** – Bi-gram vs Unigram TDM Demonstration (Notebook)  
5. **005** – Bag-of-Words Classification with TF–IDF (Notebook, full production-like code structure)  
6. **006** – SVD Classification (Notebook, full production-like code structure)  
7. **007** – Comparison of Multiple Document Classification Models (TF–IDF, SVD, Bi-directional LSTM, Transformer, ULM-Fit, DistilBERT)  
8. **008** – Regular Expressions Tutorial (Preview for Session 2)

## Notes
- Large datasets, embeddings (e.g., GloVe), and model artifacts (`.npy`, `.joblib`, etc.) are excluded via `.gitignore`.  
- Requirements (to be added) can be installed with `requirements.txt`.
